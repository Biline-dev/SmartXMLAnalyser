## **Project Scope**
The project involves developing a multi-agent application to automate the modification of complex XML documents in regulated industries such as aerospace and defense. Each agent handles specific tasks like validation, , ensuring compliance with standards such as S1000D. The application will leverage tools like generative AI to propose context-based corrections while maintaining document integrity through automated validations.
